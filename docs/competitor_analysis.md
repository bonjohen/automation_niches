# COI Tracking Competitor Analysis

## Market Overview

The Certificate of Insurance (COI) tracking market is well-established with several mature players. Key trends in 2025:

- **AI Evolution**: Moving from basic OCR to autonomous "agents" that interpret policies, flag gaps, and execute workflows
- **Pricing**: $6-$80 per vendor per year based on automation depth
- **Pain Point**: Organizations spend 15-20 hours weekly on manual certificate tracking
- **Compliance Gap**: Even 95% accuracy leaves businesses vulnerable; leading platforms achieve 90%+ compliance vs 60-70% industry average
