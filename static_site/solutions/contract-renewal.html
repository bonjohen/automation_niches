          Pain Points
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Missed renewals and lost revenue:</strong> Without robust tracking, companies frequently forget about contract auto-renewal or termination notice deadlines, leading to unwanted outcomes or lost business</li>
          <li><strong>Unapplied price escalations:</strong> Many customer contracts include escalation clauses (annual % increase or CPI-based adjustment) that are often not implemented on time - leaving money on the table</li>
          <li><strong>Fragmented contract management:</strong> Contracts might be stored in emails, shared drives, or filing cabinets with critical dates noted in disparate places - lack of central oversight means some fall through the cracks</li>
          <li><strong>Internal silos and communication breakdowns:</strong> Renewal involves coordination between sales, legal, finance, and the customer - without a system, one department might assume another is handling it</li>
          <li><strong>Reactive firefighting instead of proactive planning:</strong> In a manual world, renewals often become crises discovered late - teams rush to negotiate whatever terms to avoid service interruption</li>
        </ul>

          Typical Workflow Today
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Each contract is signed and then often "filed away" - an account manager might put a calendar reminder for a date before the contract end to revisit it</li>
          <li>As the renewal date nears (if noticed), the company will reach out to the customer to discuss renewal terms or price changes - if they forget, the contract may auto-renew or expire</li>
          <li>Price escalations are often handled by referencing the contract manually at billing time - someone in billing or sales applies the 5% increase per contract X (if there are many contracts, they might miss some)</li>
          <li>If a customer contract has a CPI-tied escalation, someone has to look up the index value at the right time and calculate the new price - possible to forget or miscalculate</li>
          <li>For termination notice clauses, oftentimes nobody actively tracks those - customers miss the chance to cancel, or vendors accidentally let a contract expire</li>
        </ul>

          Why It's Hard
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High detail and variability:</strong> Each customer contract can have different end dates, term lengths, renewal mechanisms, escalation rates, and notice requirements - keeping all these straight manually is error-prone</li>
          <li><strong>Volume and scale:</strong> As businesses grow, the number of active contracts can become hundreds - a spreadsheet approach becomes unmanageable and the likelihood of missing something increases exponentially</li>
          <li><strong>Change in personnel:</strong> Account managers or contract administrators change roles - if tracking was in someone's personal notes or calendar, that knowledge is lost</li>
          <li><strong>Psychological tendency to "set and forget":</strong> Once a contract is signed, teams often move on to the next deal - without systematic nudges, renewals slip by until it's almost too late</li>
          <li><strong>Interdependency with pricing and finance:</strong> Renewal isn't just a date - it's tied to pricing updates and performance reviews that require gathering data and coordinating multiple stakeholders</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

          How Automation Helps
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Central contract repository with alerts:</strong> Store all customer contracts with key metadata (end date, renewal terms, notice period, escalation clause) - the system automatically notifies relevant staff well before critical dates</li>
          <li><strong>Automated escalation calculation:</strong> The system can apply scheduled price increases automatically - if a contract says 3% every Jan 1, the billing amount updates or generates a reminder to update pricing</li>
          <li><strong>CPI and index integration:</strong> For CPI-tied escalations, the system can integrate index data feeds and compute the new price automatically when the CPI for December is published</li>
          <li><strong>Automated renewal notices and workflow:</strong> Software can trigger customer-facing actions - 60 days out, send a templated renewal email; internally, start a workflow for approvals if terms need review</li>
          <li><strong>Consolidated dashboard and pipeline of renewals:</strong> Management gets a view of upcoming renewals as a sales pipeline - "Next quarter: 5 contracts up for renewal, total annual value $500k"</li>
          <li><strong>Unified alerts avoid silos:</strong> Because the system is central, everyone who needs to know is kept in the loop - sales, finance, and legal can all see the status of a renewal</li>
          <li><strong>Audit trail of changes and communications:</strong> Every renewal proposal sent, price updated, or term modified is logged - useful for compliance and for learning how contracts have evolved</li>
          <li><strong>Improved customer experience:</strong> By being on top of renewals, companies can engage customers in a timely, professional manner - turning renewals into opportunities to reinforce value rather than last-minute scrambles</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue maximization:</strong> No more missing that 5% bump or letting a contract roll over without the increase - automation ensures you capture the revenue you're entitled to</li>
